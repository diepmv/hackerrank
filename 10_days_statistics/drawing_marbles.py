problem:
Task 
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?
'''

After 1 red marble is drawn, there will be 2 red marbles and 4 blue marbles in the bag. So, in the bag's current state, there is a 2/6 probability of drawing a red marble and a 4/6 probability of drawing a blue marble. Because our goal is to find the probability of drawing a blue marble, our answer is 4/6 (which reduces to 2/3).
